# Illuminations

**Illuminations** is a client sided Minecraft Fabric mod that adds multiple ambient particles in order to make your world more enjoyable at night or in dark places.
This mod is compatible with the [Canvas Renderer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer).

## Ambience

### Overworld

#### Fireflies

**Fireflies** are small flying insects that come out during the night and disappear when the sun rises. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.

#### Glowworms

**Glowworms** are small larvae living in caves by sticking to the ceiling that will fall down if their support block is removed. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.

#### Plankton

Glowing **plankton** - even though difficult to notice because of its size - can be found floating around in the dark parts of the oceanic depths. They appear in any ocean biome as long as the light is sufficiently low.

### Halloween (October Specials)

#### Autumnflies

During the month of October, fireflies will adopt an orange tint instead of their regular green one.

#### Eyes in the Dark

Also during the month of October, you may come across glowing eyes in absolutely dark spots. These eyes will disappear if you come too close or if their darkness is disturbed by a light source.

### Nether and End

#### Will o' Wisps

**Wisps** are small ghost-like creatures that appear, even though a rare sight, in Soul Sand Valleys, flying through the air and phasing through Soul Sand.

#### Chorus Petals

Appearing near Chorus flowers, these beautiful petals will twirl down to the ground, to the winds of the End, transitioning from a beautiful white to a majestic purple. The younger the flower is, the more petals will appear, and breaking a Chorus flower will provoke a burst of petals (again, the younger the flower, the more petals will burst).

## Cosmetics

In addition to the ambience changes, Illuminations also features cosmetics, primarily for those who donated and contributed to the project, with the exception of the Pride Heart Collection that is available for all [Accounts](https://illuminations.uuid.gg/register). Cosmetics can be switched and customised using the [Illuminations Dashboard](https://illuminations.uuid.gg/). Since Illuminations is client-side you can use these cosmetics even on servers. Other players with Illuminations will be able to see your cosmetics.

### Pride Hearts

Every Illuminations Account automatically has access to these 7 Pride Hearts that will follow you as pets, hovering next to your head!

### Auras

#### Twilight Aura

The **Twilight aura** creates colored fireflies that will orbit around the player. The color of the fireflies can be changed to any color you want via the Illuminations dashboard. If the player moves, they will leave a trail of these fireflies. **This aura is available to tier 1 donators.**
